chats.html

This README should will attempt to describe how to use chats.html. I will also try to describe how to tweak it.  


Pre-use: 
1. Web server listening no localhost is recommended. Files scheme should work but did not test it. 
2. You should drop the folder containing this README to your web root. 
3. I have apache and if I dropped it under htdocs (web root) I would hit chats.html like:
http://localhost/M/chats.html.
4. This should bring up the page with a pretty chat window :). 

Use: 
The chat window’s title bar is the color associated with the user you are chatting with. 
When you type something and press enter you will see your color and the text appended to the existing conversation. 
The server itself knows only few sentences so it will iterate through that list every random time duration. Therefore, it expected to be repetitive and look dumb. 
The conversation should scroll down as it is typed new messages stream in or you type a message into your text box.  

Known Issues: 
1. After you type the first chat text in your own text box and press enter then text area seems to keep it even after I clear using .val(‘’) in Jquery. I am not sure why that is the case but I have let it be in this version as it did not seem to be a big concern. 

Future Task:
1. There are lot of todos marked in the code as FUTURE WORK. Those are good examples / candidates for improvement. 
2. Styles can improve for sure. I would like to work on this at a later point. 

Credits: 
This implementation uses 
1. jQuery
2. signals
Both of them can be found under pwd{chats.html}/lib/
